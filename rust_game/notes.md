Step-by-step clock synchronization Client sends a time request: The client sends a packet to the server, embedding its current local time (\(T_{send\_client}\)) in the packet.Server receives the request: The server records the time it receives the packet (\(T_{receive\_server}\)) and notes the original client time it received.Server sends a response: The server sends a response packet to the client that includes both the time the client's packet was received (\(T_{receive\_server}\)) and the server's current time (\(T_{send\_server}\)).Client receives the response: The client records the time it receives the server's response (\(T_{receive\_client}\)).Calculate round-trip latency: The client calculates the total time it took for the packet to travel from the client to the server and back.\(Latency_{total}=T_{receive\_client}-T_{send\_client}\).Estimate one-way latency: The client approximates the one-way latency by dividing the total latency by two.\(Latency_{one-way}=Latency_{total}/2\).Calculate the time offset: The client can now estimate the difference between its clock and the server's clock.\(Offset=(T_{receive\_server}-T_{send\_client})-Latency_{one-way}\).Synchronize the client clock: The client adjusts its clock by applying the calculated offset to its own time to align with the server's time.\(GameTime_{client}=Current\_Time-Offset\).
